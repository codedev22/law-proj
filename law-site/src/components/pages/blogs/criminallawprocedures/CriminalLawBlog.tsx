              The criminal justice system in India is designed to uphold law and
              order while ensuring fairness and justice. For individuals,
              whether they are accused or victims, understanding the legal
              procedures involved in a criminal case is crucial to navigating
              the system effectively. From filing a First Information Report
              (FIR) to court trials, each stage of the process is governed by
              specific laws and provisions.

              An FIR, as outlined in Section 154 of the Code of Criminal
              Procedure (CrPC), 1973, marks the initiation of a criminal case.
              It is a written document prepared by the police based on the
              complaint of the victim or an informant. Once the FIR is
              registered, the police investigate the matter, gather evidence,
              and prepare a charge sheet under Section 173 of the CrPC. This
              document lays the foundation for prosecution in court.

              For the accused, the criminal justice system provides several
              rights to ensure a fair trial. Article 20(3) of the Constitution
              of India guarantees the right against self-incrimination, allowing
              the accused to remain silent during investigations. Bail
              provisions under Sections 436, 437, and 439 of the CrPC allow for
              temporary release depending on the nature of the offense.
              Protection against illegal detention and the right to legal
              counsel, guaranteed under Article 22, ensure that due process is
              followed.

              The role of the courts in a criminal case involves examining
              evidence, hearing arguments, and delivering a verdict. Trials are
              conducted under the procedural framework provided by the CrPC,
              with stages including the framing of charges, examination of
              witnesses, and arguments by both prosecution and defense. Sections
              227 to 235 of the CrPC specifically deal with trial procedures,
              ensuring fairness and adherence to legal norms. After the trial,
              the accused or the victim can appeal the verdict, ensuring
              multiple levels of judicial scrutiny.
