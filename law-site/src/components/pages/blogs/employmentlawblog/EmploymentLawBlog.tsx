              ensuring fair treatment of workers while upholding employers'
              rights. These laws govern wages, working conditions, benefits, and

              India's labor laws are a mix of central and state-specific
              regulations designed to safeguard the interests of both employers
              and employees. The Code on Wages, 2019, consolidates laws relating
              to minimum wages, payment of wages, and bonus. It establishes a
              universal minimum wage for all employees and mandates timely
              payment of salaries. Similarly, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947,
              focuses on dispute resolution, laying down procedures for strikes,
              lockouts, and retrenchments to promote workplace peace.

              The Code on Social Security, 2020, provides comprehensive social
              benefits, including provident funds, gratuity, and maternity
              benefits. It expands the coverage to gig and platform workers,
              ensuring broader social safety nets. Furthermore, sector-specific
              laws like the Factories Act, 1948, and state-specific Shops and
              Establishments Acts regulate working hours, leave policies, and
              workplace safety.
