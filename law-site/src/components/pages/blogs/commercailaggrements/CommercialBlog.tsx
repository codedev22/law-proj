              Contracts are the backbone of commercial transactions, offering a
              legal framework that ensures clarity, predictability, and
              enforceability. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, forms the
              cornerstone of contract law in India, laying down principles that
              govern the creation, interpretation, and enforcement of
              agreements.

                {" "}
              <b>Offer and Acceptance:</b>   The agreement must originate from a clear
                offer made by one party and its unconditional acceptance by the
                other.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Free Consent:</b>   Consent of the parties must be free from coercion,
                undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake. Sections
